    "If you landed on this blog post, then you probably want to know the answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to automatically categorise keywords using Python and save time?\n",
    "2. How the suggested solution is different to other keyword categorisation options?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are indeed already solutions available for this task. For example, [keyword tagging using Google Sheets](https://searchwilderness.com/keyword-tagging/) or [keywords categorisation for the buyers journey using Excel formula](https://www.aira.net/blog/how-to-automatically-categorise-keywords-for-the-buyers-journey/). In both cases, in order to categorise keywords, you will need to define a list of tags (or trigger words) and assign a category to each of them. You will then need to find these tags in your keywords. Once a tag is found, a keyword will be assigned to the same category as the tag that was found. "

    "|why pokemon sword and shield is bad|\n",

    "The issue that occurs here is if the inspected keyword contains more than one of your tags, this keyword will be categorised based on a tag found first in this keyword. Any other tags will be ignored. In short, this solution categorises keywords in the order in which the searched tags appear in them. Both keywords will be put into *Questions* category simply because *why* tag appears first in this keyword. The *good* and the *bad* tags will be ignored. It might be useful though to categorise our keywords based on all tags found in them, especially when we start to analyse our keyword pool together with such metrics as search volumes and/or impressions for these keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be no clash when keywords are categorised based on tags from different categories (e.g.: *Questions* and *Adjectives* tags) when using the [Google Sheet solution](https://searchwilderness.com/keyword-tagging/). However, we are facing a similar issue with keywords containing more than one tag of the same type but not sharing the same category name. For example, the keyword to categorise is *is pokemon sword and shield good or bad*, and the category names for the *good* and the *bad* tags are not *Adjectives* - not the same:\n",

    "\n",
    "The *bad* tag will be ignored as the *good* one appears first.\n",
    "\n",
